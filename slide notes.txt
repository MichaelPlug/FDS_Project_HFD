SLIDE 1
Predict if a patient is at risk for heart disease based on their clinical data

It could be intersting to determinate wich factors influence more the probabily of a heart disease. It could be useful for the patient health to recognize the status of risk and and be able to prevent it it time.

SLIDE 2
Dataset be used: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

We intend to implement a logistic regression algorithm, since the value for heart disease risk is binary (YES/NO)

We will apply patient anagraphic data, like and sex, and data from the clinical tests, like blood pressure

SLIDE 3
We pto slit the dataset and use one part for the traing set and the second one for the evaluation

For patient safety it will be necessary to minimize the number of false negatives,  maximizing the AUROC
